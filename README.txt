This assignment is an extension of from the previous assignment to improve visual quality. In this assignment, we have implemented OpenGL lighting, texturing, a skybox, and additional objects.


Keyboard inputs for camera, plane (turtle), and subparts (wings and cannon):
Camera:
Select camera to control: b
Select camera to view: v

Plane (Turtle):
s = moves the plane forward
f = moves the plane backward
e = rolls the plane (+Z rot)
q = rolls the plane (-Z rot)
a = yaws the plane (+Y rot)
d = yaws the plane (-Y rot)
z = pitches the plane (+X rot)
c = pitches the plane (-X rot)

Lighting:
i = Light up (+Y translation)
k = Light down (-Y translation)
o = Light right (+X translation)
u = Light left (-X translation)
l = Light forward (+Z translation)
j = Light backward (-Z translation)

9 = Toggles diffuse light ON/OFF
8 = Toggles ambient light ON/OFF
0 = Toggles specular light ON/OFF

## Additional
Non-trivial object = 
Skybox reference = https://jkhub.org/files/file/3216-underwater-skybox/
Texturing besides skybox =
